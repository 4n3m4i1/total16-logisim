# total16-logisim
16-bit CPU design made in Logisim 2.7.1

16 bit instruction set outlined in total16InstructionSet.txt

Current Abilities:
  Basic arithmetic
  Loading 5 and 10 bit immediates
  
Soon to Come:
  Load and store word from RAM
  Load from program memory
  Constants and Data Types
  A more complete assembler
  
Assembler:
  Reads in any file (hopefully in appropriate format..) and outputs a binary file with no extention,
  though one can be specified in the command line. A hex file is also output mirroring the binary file but with a .hex extention.
